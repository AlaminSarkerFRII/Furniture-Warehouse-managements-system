                JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share
                security information between two parties â€” a client and a
                server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set
                of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to
                ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is
                issued.
